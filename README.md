# Obstacle_avoidance_using_RL

## Description
This project focuses on developing an autonomous obstacle avoidance system for mobile robots using reinforcement learning techniques. The primary goal is to enable robots to navigate their environments safely while efficiently avoiding obstacles. The project employs Q-Learning and Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithms to train agents for optimal decision-making in dynamic environments.

## Key Objectives
- Create an autonomous system for obstacle avoidance in robots (such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and warehouse robots).
- Implement various reinforcement learning algorithms to train agents for decision-making.
- Analyze and compare the performance of Q-Learning, DQN, and DDQN in navigating simulated environments.
- Evaluate the adaptability, robustness, and efficiency of each algorithm in handling dynamic obstacle scenarios.
- Visualization of trained agent behavior in simulated environments.
